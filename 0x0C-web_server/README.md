# Web server

In this project, I learned how web servers work and began using one. I was
provided a personal server by Holberton School. I learned how to use `scp`
and Fabric to transfer files to my server. Additionally, I completed a basic
configuration of the server using Nginx.

The server is accessible at [nicmarsolutions.tech](http://nicmarsolutions.tech).

## Tasks

* **0. Transfer a file to your server**
  * [0-transfer_file](./0-transfer_file): Bash script that transfers a file
  from client to a server.
  * Accepts four arguments:
    * The path of the file to be transferred.
    * The IP of the server to transfer the file to.
    * The username that `scp` connects with.
    * The path of the SSH privtae key that `scp` uses.
  * `scp` transfers the file to the user home directory `~/`.

* **1. Install nginx web server**
  * [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server): Bash script
  that configures a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx.
  * Nginx listens on port 80.
  * When querying Nginx at its root `/` with a `curl` GET request,
  it returns a page containing the string `Hello World`.

* **2. Setup a domain name**
  * [2-setup_a_domain_name](./2-setup_a_domain_name): A text file containing
  the domain name set up for the server through Gandi.

* **3. Redirection**
  * [3-redirection](./3-redirection): Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu
  machine with Nginx.
  * Setup is identical to [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
  plus:
    * The location `/redirect_me` returns a `301 Moved Permanently` redirection
    to another page.

* **4. Not found page 404**
  * [4-not_found_page_404](./4-not_found_page_404): Bash script that configures
  a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx.
  * Setup is identical to [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
  plus:
    * Features a custom 404 page containing the string `Ceci n'est pas une page`.

* **5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)**
  * [7-puppet_install_nginx_web_server.pp](./7-puppet_install_nginx_web_server.pp)
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.

Requirements:

Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hellow World
The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
